# scIntegration
Single-cell omics integration using deep generative models. Work-in-progress. Everything from exploratory data analysis to model building and testing. 

This is just for tracking and versioning experiments - the final results will be presented in an alternative repository. The code will be refactored and more extensively commented on to explain each element.

This repository is linked to a private Weights & Biases project for debugging, but the final experiments will be tracked in a public project.
